# ouunit
LaTeX style files for creating documents in the Open University unit style.

This package provides the ouunit class file. It depends on many files that are
included in the CTAN archive. Modern latex systems should download these
automatically.

The example.tex file also needs the outikz.sty style file for formatting diagrams
in using Open University styles. This style file is found in the archive for
supplementary materials:
